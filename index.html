        <h2> About us </h2>
        <p>
          <img id="alan" src="img/Alan.png" width=84 height=88>
          Alan Gómez Pasillas is the real CEO
          of the enterprise, he does all the
          work that the company makes at least
          for now, he loves drawing, programming,
          music, innovation, creativity and
          nature. He wants to be a good person
          and wants everyone to be happy. Alan has
          born in Mexico, it was august 16th 2001,
          he used to play videogames with his
          father since he was a kid, that is possibly
          the reason he loves making videogames.
          <br><br>
          Mystic Prisma is just a small enterprise
          that wants to share art and good things
          to the world. Nowadays there's only one
          worker here, the CEO, we are planning to
          grow the company when we are able to do
          it and provide jobs to animators, graphic
          designers and programmers that are entry
          level, so they can have money from what
          they like and also learn about working for
          a company that has those needs.
          <br><br>
          We have made a little bunch of videogames
          already, Mystic Prisma was founded on 2012
          by Alan, initially we were known as Alan Games
          Production Entertainment, and previously
          had a club called Super Club Chido, after some
          years AGPE became Mystic Prisma to be open
          for more future workers and not just Alan.
          <br><br>
          Some of our most interesting games are TOPEA and Alan
          el regreso, TOPEA is also a sport created by
          Alan and developed for android by himself, 
          Alan el regreso is still not finished but
          it is a platformer that involves fights and
          a very interesting story.
          <br><br>
          Amigo Programador is one of our most liked projects, 
          its purpose is to provide quality learning to people
          that is studying programming and for things that are
          not very usual right now like assembly, a lot of knowledege
          is disappearing, and sometimes it is possible to find it
          but it is still difficult and sometimes to understand
          as well, that is the main purpose, share valuable knowledge
          with the world.

        <h2>Los Alancinos</h2>
        <p>
          Los alancinos is a rock band made by Mystic Prisma, it
          started just with Alan Wade, he knew Alan Tob, then brate
          join the band and lastly they found Zop, they found they
          have got intense experiences and they also share same likes,
          everyone play different musical instruments and have different,
          tone of voice, now they are still making the first album,
          it is called Pasando por el Pasado, where they tell about some
          of their most impacting experiences.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Alan Wade</h3>

          <img class="game-img profile" src="img/WadePicture_1.png"/>
          <p>
            Alan Wade Muyel is the one who decided to make a rock band, but
            he was just a single, he knows how to play different instruments
            but now he has friends what he does is composing the lyrics and
            plays the acoustic guitar in some of the songs, he is also the
            main vocalist of the band, this is due to his tone of voice, it
            is in an intermediate place between the voice of the others.
          </p>
        </div><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
        <h3>Alan Tob</h3>
          <div class="flex-box">
            <img class="game-img profile" src="img/TobPicture_1.png"/>
            <p>
              Alan Tob became the second member of the band, he listened at
              the first song made by wade and decided to contact him, in that
              moment, Wade invited him to be a member, Tob is the best in the
              piano, he likes sad and calming sound, his voice is brighter,
              and likes to add armonies to the choirs, he loves animals and
              music, he is a bit shy but he enjoys the life.
