      <h2> About us </h2>
      <p>
        <img id="alan" src="img/Alan.png" width=84 height=88>
        Alan Gómez Pasillas is the real CEO
        of the enterprise, he does all the
        work that the company makes at least
        for now, he loves drawing, programming,
        music, innovation, creativity and
        nature. He wants to be a good person
        and wants everyone to be happy. Alan has
        born in Mexico, it was august 16th 2001,
        he used to play videogames with his
        father since he was a kid, that is possibly
        the reason he loves making videogames.
        <br><br>
        Mystic Prisma is just a small enterprise
        that wants to share art and good things
        to the world. Nowadays there's only one
        worker here, the CEO, we are planning to
        grow the company when we are able to do
        it and provide jobs to animators, graphic
        designers and programmers that are entry
        level, so they can have money from what
        they like and also learn about working for
        a company that has those needs.
        <br><br>
        We have made a little bunch of videogames
        already, Mystic Prisma was founded on 2012
        by Alan, initially we were known as Alan Games
        Production Entertainment, and previously
        had a club called Super Club Chido, after some
        years AGPE became Mystic Prisma to be open
        for more future workers and not just Alan.
        <br><br>
        Some of our most interesting games are TOPEA and Alan
        el regreso, TOPEA is also a sport created by
        Alan and developed for android by himself, 
        Alan el regreso is still not finished but
        it is a platformer that involves fights and
        a very interesting story.
        <br><br>
        Amigo Programador is one of our most liked projects, 
        its purpose is to provide quality learning to people
        that is studying programming and for things that are
        not very usual right now like assembly, a lot of knowledege
        is disappearing, and sometimes it is possible to find it
        but it is still difficult and sometimes to understand
        as well, that is the main purpose, share valuable knowledge
        with the world.
